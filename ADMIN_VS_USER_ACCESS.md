# Admin vs User Access Control

## Summary
The system now has proper role-based access control where regular users see only their own data, but admins can see everything.

---

## Access Control Rules

### Regular Users (student/guest)
- ‚úÖ See **only their own** chat sessions
- ‚úÖ See **only their own** messages
- ‚úÖ See **only their own** uploaded documents
- ‚úÖ Can delete **only their own** sessions
- ‚úÖ Can search **only their own** messages
- ‚ùå Cannot see other users' data
- ‚ùå Cannot access admin endpoints

### Admin Users
- ‚úÖ See **ALL** chat sessions (from all users)
- ‚úÖ See **ALL** messages (from all users)
- ‚úÖ See **ALL** uploaded documents (from all users)
- ‚úÖ Can delete **ANY** session
- ‚úÖ Can manage users
- ‚úÖ Full system access

## Current Situation

Based on the database:

### Documents (15 total)
- **Admin (68edd25c08f20b54baace9d6):** 14 documents
  - SE_Final-Unit-1-Notes.pdf
  - SE_Unit_2_Notes.pdf
  - KR23 NLP UNIT 1 Notes Final.pdf
  - And 11 more...
  
- **s123@gmail.com (68edd55f08f20b54baace9d7):** 1 document
  - WT_Unit_1[1].pdf

### Sessions (21 total)
- **Admin:** 21 sessions, 130 messages

---

## What Each User Sees

### When Sankeertana (s123@gmail.com) logs in:
- **Document Library:** 1 document (WT_Unit_1[1].pdf)
- **History:** Only their own chat sessions
- **Search:** Only searches their own messages

### When Admin (admin@smartdoc.com) logs in:
- **Document Library:** All 15 documents
- **History:** All 21 sessions from all users
- **Search:** Searches all messages from all users

## How to Get More Documents for s123

Since s123 only has 1 document, to see more documents they need to:

### Option 1: Upload New Documents
1. Log in as s123@gmail.com
2. Go to Upload page
3. Upload a PDF document
4. The document will be tagged with s123's user_id
5. It will appear in s123's Document Library

### Option 2: Reassign Existing Documents (Admin Action)
If you want s123 to see some of the admin's documents, you need to change the user_id in those document chunks from admin's ID to s123's ID.

---

## Technical Implementation

### Documents Endpoint
```python
if user_role == "admin":
    # Return all documents
    return all_docs
else:
    # Filter by user_id
    return [doc for doc in all_docs if doc.user_id == current_user_id]
```

### History Endpoint
```python
if user_role == "admin":
    query = {}  # No filter - get all
else:
    query = {"user_id": current_user_id}  # Filter by user
```

### Sessions Endpoint
```python
if user_role == "admin":
    query_filter = {}  # Admin sees all sessions
else:
    query_filter = {"user_id": user_id}  # Users see only their own
```

## Testing

### Test as Regular User (s123)
1. Log in as s123@gmail.com
2. Check Document Library ‚Üí Should see 1 document
3. Check History ‚Üí Should see only s123's sessions
4. Upload a new document ‚Üí Should appear in library
5. Try to access admin's session ‚Üí Should get 403 Forbidden

### Test as Admin
1. Log in as admin@smartdoc.com
2. Check Document Library ‚Üí Should see all 15 documents
3. Check History ‚Üí Should see all 21 sessions
4. Can view any user's sessions
5. Can delete any session

## Database Structure

### Document Chunks (ChromaDB)
```javascript
{
  "id": "chunk_uuid",
  "text": "...",
  "metadata": {
    "document_id": "doc_uuid",
    "user_id": "68edd55f08f20b54baace9d7",  // ‚Üê Owner
    "filename": "WT_Unit_1[1].pdf",
    "chunk_index": 0
  }
}
```

### Sessions (MongoDB)
```javascript
{
  "session_id": "session_...",
  "user_id": "68edd55f08f20b54baace9d7",  // ‚Üê Owner
  "title": "Chat about...",
  "message_count": 8
}
```

### Messages (MongoDB)
```javascript
{
  "session_id": "session_...",
  "user_id": "68edd55f08f20b54baace9d7",  // ‚Üê Owner
  "message_type": "user",
  "content": "..."
}
```

## Why s123 Sees 0 Documents

The script output showed:
```
1. WT_Unit_1[1].pdf
   User ID: 68edd55f08f20b54baace9d7  ‚Üê This is s123's document
   
2-15. Other documents
   User ID: 68edd25c08f20b54baace9d6  ‚Üê These belong to admin
```

So s123 should actually see **1 document** (WT_Unit_1[1].pdf), not 0.

If s123 is seeing 0 documents, check the terminal logs when they refresh the Document Library page. The logs will show:
- Total docs in vector store
- User ID and role
- Which documents match the user_id

## Summary

‚úÖ **Regular users:** Personal data only
‚úÖ **Admin:** All data from all users
‚úÖ **Documents:** Filtered by user_id (except admin)
‚úÖ **Sessions:** Filtered by user_id (except admin)
‚úÖ **Messages:** Filtered by user_id (except admin)

**The system now properly implements role-based access control!** üîí
