# SmartDocQ Deployment Status

## Current Issue
**CORS Error**: Render keeps reverting to old code when service spins down (free tier limitation)

## What's Been Fixed (In Code)
‚úÖ CORS middleware with regex pattern for all `*.vercel.app` domains
‚úÖ Model pre-download during build phase
‚úÖ Frontend timeout increased to 2 minutes
‚úÖ All Vercel URLs added to allowed origins

## Current Deployment State
‚ùå Render is running OLD code without CORS fix
‚ùå Service keeps spinning down and losing configuration

## Solution Required
**Manual Redeploy with Cache Clear**

### Steps to Fix:
1. Go to: https://dashboard.render.com
2. Click your backend service: `smartdocq-ne65`
3. Click **"Manual Deploy"** (top right)
4. Select **"Clear build cache & deploy"**
5. Wait 5-7 minutes for deployment
6. Verify logs show: `‚úÖ CORS middleware configured with regex pattern for *.vercel.app`

## Verification After Deployment
Check Render logs for these lines:
```
üîß CORS: Allowing origins: [..., 'https://smartdocq-indol.vercel.app']
üîß CORS: Also allowing all *.vercel.app domains via regex pattern
‚úÖ CORS middleware configured with regex pattern for *.vercel.app
‚úÖ CORS will allow any domain matching: https://.*\.vercel\.app
```

## Production URLs
- **Frontend**: https://smartdocq-indol.vercel.app
- **Backend**: https://smartdocq-ne65.onrender.com
- **Preview**: https://smartdocq-ivd03drlu-sankeertanas-projects.vercel.app

## Known Limitations (Render Free Tier)
- Service spins down after 15 minutes of inactivity
- Sometimes reverts to cached/old code on restart
- Requires manual redeploy to ensure latest code is running
- Model download causes timeouts on first upload after restart

## Recommended Next Steps
1. **Immediate**: Manual redeploy with cache clear
2. **Short-term**: Test upload immediately after deployment (while service is warm)
3. **Long-term**: Consider upgrading to Render paid plan ($7/month) to keep service always running
