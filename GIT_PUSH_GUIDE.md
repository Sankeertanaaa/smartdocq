## Git Commands

### Option 1: Single Command (Recommended)
```bash
cd c:\Users\DELL\smartdoc3
git add .
git commit -m "Fix authentication, upload, and dependency issues

Authentication fixes:
- Skip auth headers for static files (manifest.json)
- Auto-clear invalid tokens on 401 errors
- Enhanced token verification debugging

Upload fixes:
- Add batch processing for embeddings (50 chunks/batch)
- Limit documents to 500 chunks max
- Better error messages for memory/timeout issues

Dependency fixes:
- Update sentence-transformers to 2.7.0
- Fix huggingface_hub compatibility issue

Closes upload failures and 401 authentication errors"
git push origin main
```

### Option 2: Step by Step
```bash
# 1. Check status
git status

# 2. Add all changes
git add .

# 3. Commit with message
git commit -m "Fix authentication, upload, and dependency issues"

# 4. Push to remote
git push origin main
```

### If You Get "Branch Not Found" Error
```bash
# Check your branch name
git branch

# If it's 'master' instead of 'main'
git push origin master
```

## After Pushing

### 1. Wait for Deployments
- **Vercel (Frontend)**: ~2-3 minutes
- **Render (Backend)**: ~5-7 minutes (longer due to dependency installation)

### 2. Monitor Render Deployment
1. Go to https://dashboard.render.com
2. Click on your backend service
3. Click "Logs" tab
4. Watch for:
   ```
   ==> Installing dependencies
   ==> Collecting sentence-transformers==2.7.0
   ==> Successfully installed sentence-transformers-2.7.0
   ==> Your service is live ðŸŽ‰
   ```

### 3. Test the Application

#### Test 1: Clear Old Tokens
```javascript
// In browser console
localStorage.clear();
```

#### Test 2: Login
1. Go to your app URL
2. Login with your credentials
3. Should work without 401 errors

#### Test 3: Upload Small File
1. Try uploading a small DOCX or PDF (< 5MB)
2. Should see success message
3. Check Render logs for:
   ```
   âœ… SentenceTransformer model loaded successfully
   âœ… Encoded X texts successfully
   All X chunks successfully added to vector store
   ```

#### Test 4: Upload Your 12MB PDF
1. Try uploading SE_Unit_2_Notes.pdf
2. Should process successfully (may truncate to 500 chunks if very large)

## Troubleshooting

### If Push Fails
```bash
# Pull latest changes first
git pull origin main

# Resolve any conflicts, then
git add .
git commit -m "Merge and fix conflicts"
git push origin main
```

### If Render Deployment Fails
1. Check Render logs for errors
2. Common issues:
   - Dependency installation timeout â†’ Retry deployment
   - Out of memory â†’ Upgrade to paid tier
   - Build failed â†’ Check requirements.txt syntax

### If Uploads Still Fail After Deployment
1. Check Render logs for the exact error
2. Verify sentence-transformers installed correctly:
   ```
   Successfully installed sentence-transformers-2.7.0
   ```
3. Try a very small file first (< 1MB)

## Expected Timeline

- **Git push**: Instant
- **Vercel deploy**: 2-3 minutes
- **Render deploy**: 5-7 minutes
- **First upload**: 30-60 seconds (model download)
- **Subsequent uploads**: 5-10 seconds

## Success Indicators

### Frontend Console
```
âœ… Token verified successfully
No more manifest.json 401 errors
```

### Backend Logs
```
âœ… SentenceTransformer model loaded successfully
âœ… Encoded X texts successfully
All X chunks successfully added to vector store
âœ… Document record saved to MongoDB
```

### User Experience
- âœ… Login works without errors
- âœ… Upload completes successfully
- âœ… Can chat with uploaded documents
- âœ… No more 401 or 500 errors

## Next Steps After Successful Deploy

1. Test all features thoroughly
2. Monitor Render logs for any errors
3. Check memory usage in Render dashboard
4. Consider upgrading to paid tier if uploads are slow

## Questions?

If you encounter issues:
1. Check Render logs first
2. Check browser console for frontend errors
3. Try clearing cache and localStorage
4. Verify both frontend and backend deployed successfully
